PR-Review Bounty Gate — on-arrival adjudication of Bounty #73 code-review claims.

Runs per newly-opened/edited issue. For a code-review claim it verifies, against
the (public) Rustchain repo, that the claimant was the FIRST substantive reviewer
of the referenced PR, within the per-contributor cap. Conservative:
  - clear NOT-FIRST / rubber-stamp / over-cap  -> close (not planned) + comment
  - eligible                                   -> label 'bounty-eligible' + comment
  - ambiguous / no PR ref / non-native wallet  -> label 'needs-human' (no close)
Idempotent: skips issues already labeled/closed by the gate.

Env: GITHUB_TOKEN (repo + public read), GH_REPO (owner/name), ISSUE_NUMBER,
     TARGET_REPO (default Scottcjn/Rustchain), CAP (default 15), RATE_RTC (3).

# Rubber-stamp detector (Bounty #73: "LGTM", generic praise, or emoji
# reaction does not establish first-reviewer position). Bounty #73
# explicitly states terse praise with no line-level findings does not
# establish the first-reviewer slot. The helper logic lives in
# is_substantive_review() below; this block only defines the phrase list
# and the regex.
#
# Heuristic (intentionally narrow — only flags the obvious cases the
# 2026-06-06 clarification on issue #73 calls out):
#   1. Any review with >=1 inline comment is substantive (handled in
#      is_substantive_review).
#   2. Any review whose body is long enough to plausibly carry a finding
#      (>=80 chars after stripping whitespace) is substantive (handled
#      in is_substantive_review).
#   3. Any review whose body contains a file path, a line reference
#      like `L:NN`, a marker like "Ref:", "Finding", "Bug", "Issue:",
#      "Security", "Risk", "Guard", or a Markdown code fence, is
#      substantive (caught by _SUBSTANTIVE_MARKER_RE).
#   4. Emoji-only bodies are rubber-stamps (caught by _EMOJI_ONLY_RE).
#   5. Bodies that match the canonical "LGTM / great work / thanks"
#      pattern with no other content are rubber-stamps (caught by
#      _RUBBER_STAMP_RE). The pattern is anchored at the start (`^\s*`)
#      but the trailing class only allows whitespace, non-word chars,
#      and emoji, so a praise phrase that is immediately followed by
#      substantive text (e.g. "Great work, but the file path is
#      missing") will NOT match — _SUBSTANTIVE_MARKER_RE.search() will
#      catch the file path above.

# Substantive-marker regex. Used to detect file paths, line refs, and
# finding keywords. Defined BEFORE the rubber-stamp regex so the

# a marker is never rubber-stamp, even if it also starts with a praise
