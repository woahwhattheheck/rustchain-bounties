RTC Auto-Pay — GitHub Actions script for automatic RTC payment on PR merge.

Scans PR comments for a payment directive from the repo owner, then calls
the RustChain VPS transfer API and posts a confirmation comment.

Payment directive format (in a PR comment by repo owner):
    **Payment: 75 RTC**
    Payment: 75 RTC

Environment variables (set by the GitHub Action):
    GITHUB_TOKEN    — GitHub token for API access
    PR_NUMBER       — Pull request number
    REPO            — Repository in "owner/repo" format
    PR_AUTHOR       — GitHub username of the PR author
    RTC_VPS_HOST    — RustChain VPS IP (e.g. 50.28.86.131)
    RTC_ADMIN_KEY   — Admin key for /wallet/transfer
    REPO_OWNER      — Repository owner username (e.g. Scottcjn)
