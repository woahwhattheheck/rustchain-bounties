"""Sweep un-adjudicated PR-review claims through the #73 gate.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
`pr-review-gate.yml` fires on `issues: [opened, edited]`. That adjudicates a
claim exactly once, at the instant it is filed, and never again. Any claim
that missed that instant -- filed while the gate was failing, filed before the
gate existed, or edited in a way that did not re-trigger -- was invisible
forever. It sat open with no label, no verdict, and no reply.

That single trigger config produced a backlog of 104 silent claims with a
median age of 82 days, across 44 real contributors. `bounty_payout.py` only
pays claims the gate has labelled, so silence there meant no payout, which
meant contributors stopped showing up.

This sweep is the safety net: it re-drives the same gate over anything that
was never adjudicated, so a missed webhook costs a few hours instead of
forever.

SAFETY
------
  - The gate itself is idempotent: it skips issues it has already labelled or
    closed. Re-running is harmless.
  - Discovery paginates ALL open issues. MAX_PER_RUN bounds adjudication work,
    not discovery; otherwise an issue outside a discovery cap can be stranded
    forever while the run reports a clean queue.
  - Bounded per run (MAX_PER_RUN, default 60) so one sweep cannot exhaust the
    API budget. When the bound truncates the queue, the remainder is REPORTED,
    not silently dropped -- a silent cap reads as "everything is handled".
  - Only touches issues whose title is a review claim, per the gate's own
    `is_review_claim`, so it cannot wander into unrelated issues.

Env: GITHUB_TOKEN, GH_REPO, TARGET_REPO, CAP, RATE_RTC, MAX_PER_RUN,
     PROCESSED_LABEL.
