"""Adjudicate docstring bounty claims.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
The #73 gate only recognises CODE-REVIEW claims -- `is_review_claim()` requires
"review" in the title. Every other bounty type falls straight through it, so
docstring, blog, star and bug claims had no automated adjudication at all and
simply accumulated unpaid. On 2026-08-10 that was 19 open docstring claims,
batches 31 to 49, none of them gate-processed.

Docstring claims are unusually verifiable, so they are worth gating properly
rather than paying on assertion. A claim states a PR, a file, a function count
and a rate, and the diff should be `+N/-0` where N is that count.

WHAT IT VERIFIES (all of it, before paying anything)
  1. The cited PR is **MERGED**. An open PR is not delivered work.
  2. The PR touches the claimed file.
  3. The added lines are **actually docstrings** -- lines opening with a quote
     triple. This is the check that matters: without it "I added 40 docstrings"
     pays out for 40 lines of anything.
  4. The claimed count matches what was really added.

PAYMENT IS COMPUTED FROM THE VERIFIED COUNT, NEVER THE CLAIMED ONE. A claim
that overstates is paid the true amount rather than rejected outright -- the
usual cause is miscounting, not fraud, and rejecting honest arithmetic errors
teaches people to stop claiming.

Sets `bounty-eligible` + `docstring-verified` and posts the arithmetic, so the
existing payout runner pays it on its next pass. Never moves RTC itself.

# At 0.01 RTC/function the weekly cap is a soft backstop, not the constraint:

# types in a week (measured 2026-08-10: typical top earners 20-50 RTC/week).
