Bounty payout — pays verified-eligible code-review claims as wallets confirm.

Completes the pipeline: the PR-review gate labels a claim `bounty-eligible`
(or a maintainer comments "Verified eligible"); when the claimant adds a native
RTC wallet, this run pays 3 RTC from founder_community and closes the claim.

If the claim has no native `RTC[0-9a-fA-F]{40}` address, the script falls
back to a GitHub handle from the issue body or a recent `Wallet: <handle>`
comment - matching the rtc-reward action's handle-fallback (PR #13394).
Bots are excluded so automation cannot farm rewards.

SAFETY:
  - pays ONLY verified-eligible claims (gate label or "Verified eligible" comment)
  - native RTC wallet preferred; handle fallback is opt-in
  - handle fallback excludes bot accounts (`type == 'Bot'` or `[bot]` suffix)
  - idempotency_key=bounty73-claim-<n> + 'RTC-AutoPay-Confirmed' marker => never double-pays
  - MAX_PER_RUN aggregate cap (default 40) — hard stop per run, surfaced in log
Env: GITHUB_TOKEN, RTC_ADMIN_KEY, RTC_VPS_HOST, GH_REPO, RATE_RTC(3), MAX_PER_RUN(40).
